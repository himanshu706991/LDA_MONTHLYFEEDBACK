To create a comparison view between quarterly and yearly net loss data, incorporating moving averages and error metrics, we can build a detailed analysis pipeline. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Objective of the Comparison
Compare how the net loss distribution behaves on a quarterly basis vs. a yearly basis.
Use moving averages to smooth fluctuations and identify trends.
Include error metrics like MAE, RMSE, and variability measures for quantitative comparison.
2. Methodology
a) Prepare Data
Aggregate the data at yearly and quarterly levels.
Calculate moving averages for both yearly and quarterly net loss values.
b) Comparison Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Shows the average deviation from the moving average.
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Highlights larger deviations from the moving average.
Coefficient of Variation (CV): Captures variability relative to the mean.
Seasonality Check: Highlights how quarterly patterns differ from yearly patterns.
c) Visualization
Line plots comparing quarterly and yearly data with moving averages.
Bar charts to visualize net loss totals per year and quarter.
Overlayed moving averages for quarterly and yearly trends.
3. Implementation
Code Example
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Assuming `data` is your dataset with 'Date', 'Business Line', 'Net Loss Amount'
# Convert Date to datetime and extract year and quarter
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data['Year'] = data['Date'].dt.year
data['Quarter'] = data['Date'].dt.to_period('Q')

# Aggregate data yearly and quarterly
yearly_data = data.groupby(['Year', 'Business Line'])['Net Loss Amount'].sum().reset_index()
quarterly_data = data.groupby(['Quarter', 'Business Line'])['Net Loss Amount'].sum().reset_index()

# Add Moving Averages
yearly_data['Yearly Moving Avg'] = yearly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean())
quarterly_data['Quarterly Moving Avg'] = quarterly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=4, min_periods=1).mean())

# Calculate Metrics
mae_yearly = mean_absolute_error(yearly_data['Net Loss Amount'], yearly_data['Yearly Moving Avg'])
mae_quarterly = mean_absolute_error(quarterly_data['Net Loss Amount'], quarterly_data['Quarterly Moving Avg'])

rmse_yearly = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(yearly_data['Net Loss Amount'], yearly_data['Yearly Moving Avg']))
rmse_quarterly = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(quarterly_data['Net Loss Amount'], quarterly_data['Quarterly Moving Avg']))

# Visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(12, 10), sharex=True)

# Plot Yearly Data
for business_line in yearly_data['Business Line'].unique():
    bl_data = yearly_data[yearly_data['Business Line'] == business_line]
    ax[0].plot(bl_data['Year'], bl_data['Net Loss Amount'], label=f"{business_line} - Actual")
    ax[0].plot(bl_data['Year'], bl_data['Yearly Moving Avg'], linestyle='--', label=f"{business_line} - MA")

# Plot Quarterly Data
for business_line in quarterly_data['Business Line'].unique():
    bl_data = quarterly_data[quarterly_data['Business Line'] == business_line]
    ax[1].plot(bl_data['Quarter'].astype(str), bl_data['Net Loss Amount'], label=f"{business_line} - Actual")
    ax[1].plot(bl_data['Quarter'].astype(str), bl_data['Quarterly Moving Avg'], linestyle='--', label=f"{business_line} - MA")

# Customize Plot
ax[0].set_title("Yearly Net Loss and Moving Average")
ax[1].set_title("Quarterly Net Loss and Moving Average")
ax[1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

for a in ax:
    a.set_ylabel("Net Loss Amount")
    a.legend(loc='best')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print Metrics
print(f"Yearly MAE: {mae_yearly:.2f}")
print(f"Quarterly MAE: {mae_quarterly:.2f}")
print(f"Yearly RMSE: {rmse_yearly:.2f}")
print(f"Quarterly RMSE: {rmse_quarterly:.2f}")
4. Metrics for Client Explanation
Error Metrics:

Lower MAE and RMSE for quarterly data suggest more precise tracking and insights.
If yearly data has lower metrics, it shows less fluctuation but misses short-term trends.
Seasonality and Trend Insights:

Highlight quarterly patterns using the moving average, which reveals seasonal fluctuations.
Use yearly moving averages for long-term trends.
Coefficient of Variation:

Compare CV for both timeframes to identify variability in net loss.
5. Visual Explanation to Client
Example Insights:
Quarterly Data:
Captures seasonal spikes, providing more granular insights into business line performance.
Higher variability, indicating potential risks or opportunities that yearly data might overlook.
Yearly Data:
Smooths fluctuations, offering a big-picture view.
Lower variability, better for strategic planning.
Suggested Presentation:
Use graphs with:
Dual lines for actual and moving averages.
Clearly annotated error metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).
Highlighted quarterly spikes compared to yearly trends.
This approach provides a clear, data-driven comparison that balances granularity and strategic overview. Let me know if you'd like to refine this further!

Increase the event count by 10% for each business line and net loss for each business line by 10% code for that
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s Python code to increase the event count and net loss for each business line by 10%:

Code Implementation
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = {
    "Business Line": ["Retail", "Corporate Banking", "Investment Banking", "Insurance"],
    "Event Count": [100, 200, 150, 250],
    "Net Loss Amount": [500000, 1200000, 800000, 1000000]
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Increase Event Count and Net Loss Amount by 10%
df["Adjusted Event Count"] = df["Event Count"] * 1.1  # Increase by 10%
df["Adjusted Net Loss Amount"] = df["Net Loss Amount"] * 1.1  # Increase by 10%

# Convert to integers for event counts (optional)
df["Adjusted Event Count"] = df["Adjusted Event Count"].round(0).astype(int)

# Display the updated DataFrame
print(df)
Explanation
Columns Adjusted:

Event Count is increased by multiplying by 1.1.
Net Loss Amount is similarly increased by multiplying by 1.1.
Rounding:

Event counts are rounded to the nearest integer for practical reporting.
Result:

The new columns (Adjusted Event Count and Adjusted Net Loss Amount) reflect the updated values after a 10% increase.
Output
If the original data looks like this:

Business Line	Event Count	Net Loss Amount
Retail	100	500,000
Corporate Banking	200	1,200,000
Investment Banking	150	800,000
Insurance	250	1,000,000
The output will be:

Business Line	Event Count	Net Loss Amount	Adjusted Event Count	Adjusted Net Loss Amount
Retail	100	500,000	110	550,000
Corporate Banking	200	1,200,000	220	1,320,000

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Using a moving average is an excellent way to smooth out fluctuations in the data and reveal underlying trends. It allows you to compare the loss distribution across years versus quarters for each business line more effectively.

Why Use Moving Averages for Comparison?
Yearly Basis:

A moving average smooths the annual net loss to show long-term trends and reduces the effect of outliers in individual years.
Useful for analyzing the overall stability or growth of losses.
Quarterly Basis:

A moving average highlights seasonal or cyclical trends in net loss distribution.
Useful for identifying patterns like consistent increases in certain quarters or periodic spikes.
Comparison Insight:

If quarterly data fluctuates more than yearly data, it suggests high short-term volatility.
Yearly data may hide such details, leading to less actionable insights compared to quarterly data.
Implementation Steps
Compute Moving Averages:

Calculate a moving average for both yearly and quarterly net loss for each business line.
Use different window sizes (e.g., 4 for quarterly data to smooth over a year, 2 for yearly data to smooth over two years).
Plot Moving Averages:

Compare smoothed trends for quarterly and yearly data on the same graph.
Use separate graphs for each business line to highlight differences.
Code Example
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = {
    "Date": pd.date_range(start="2020-01-01", periods=36, freq="M"),  # Monthly data for 3 years

        ["Retail", "Corporate Banking", "Investment Banking", "Insurance"], size=36
    ),
    "Net Loss Amount": np.random.uniform(10000, 200000, 36)
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Extract Year and Quarter
df["Year"] = df["Date"].dt.year
df["Quarter"] = df["Date"].dt.quarter

# Aggregate by Year and Quarter
yearly_data = df.groupby(["Year", "Business Line"])["Net Loss Amount"].sum().reset_index()
quarterly_data = df.groupby(["Year", "Quarter", "Business Line"])["Net Loss Amount"].sum().reset_index()

# Calculate Moving Average
yearly_data["Yearly Moving Avg"] = (
    yearly_data.groupby("Business Line")["Net Loss Amount"].rolling(window=2).mean().reset_index(drop=True)

Interpretation of Results
Yearly Trends:

Use the smoothed yearly moving averages to highlight long-term trends (e.g., gradual increases or decreases).
Look for trends like whether net loss is growing across all business lines over the years.
Quarterly Trends:

Use the smoothed quarterly moving averages to identify patterns within each year.
For example, a spike in Q4 might suggest seasonality or end-of-year adjustments.
Comparison:

If quarterly moving averages show more detailed patterns or fluctuations, suggest that quarterly data provides better insights for operational planning.
If yearly trends are sufficient for capturing long-term patterns, suggest using yearly data for high-level decision-making.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For comparing the yearly and quarterly net loss data for business lines, you can use various error metrics and performance measures to determine which level of granularity provides more meaningful insights. Here are some approaches:

1. Error Metrics for Comparison
a) Hit Rate
Definition: Measures how often a significant event (e.g., high net loss) is correctly identified in the dataset at both yearly and quarterly levels.
Use Case: Compare how effectively quarterly vs. yearly data highlights important patterns.
Formula:
Hit Rate
=
Number of Correct Detections
Total Significant Events
Hit Rate= 
Total Significant Events
Number of Correct Detections

 
b) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Measures the deviation between the observed values and moving average predictions.
Useful for determining whether quarterly or yearly moving averages provide better alignment with actual data.
Formula (MAE):
MAE
=
∑
∣
𝑦

c) Seasonality Error (For Quarterly Data)
Quantifies how much seasonal variation contributes to the differences in net loss between yearly and quarterly data.
Calculate using seasonal decomposition of time series (STL).
2. Heterogeneity Metrics
a) Heteroscedasticity Check
Measures variability of net loss across quarters and years.
Use the Breusch-Pagan Test or White's Test to check if quarterly data has higher variance compared to yearly data.
b) Coefficient of Variation (CV)
Captures variability relative to the mean.
Formula:
CV
=
Standard Deviation
Mean
CV=

Measures the proportion of meaningful patterns (signal) to random variation (noise).
Higher SNR in quarterly data might indicate more actionable insights.
Formula:
SNR
=
Mean
Standard Deviation
SNR= 
Standard Deviation
Mean

 
b) Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test
Assess whether the distribution of net loss (or significant events) aligns better with the observed data at quarterly or yearly levels.
4. Visualization-Based Metrics
a) Explained Variance
Compare how much of the total variance in net loss is explained by quarterly vs. yearly trends using regression or decomposition techniques.
b) Event Detection Accuracy
Use moving averages or anomaly detection to identify spikes in net loss.
Compare precision, recall, and F1-score of event detection in yearly vs. quarterly data.
Code Example for MAE, Hit Rate, and Coefficient of Variation
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Assuming 'yearly_data' and 'quarterly_data' have actual and moving average predictions
# Calculate MAE and RMSE for Yearly and Quarterly Data
yearly_mae = mean_absolute_error(yearly_data["Net Loss Amount"], yearly_data["Yearly Moving Avg"])
quarterly_mae = mean_absolute_error(quarterly_data["Net Loss Amount"], quarterly_data["Quarterly Moving Avg"])

yearly_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(yearly_data["Net Loss Amount"], yearly_data["Yearly Moving Avg"]))
quarterly_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(quarterly_data["Net Loss Amount"], quarterly_data["Quarterly Moving Avg"]))

# Coefficient of Variation
yearly_cv = yearly_data["Net Loss Amount"].std() / yearly_data["Net Loss Amount"].mean()
quarterly_cv = quarterly_data["Net Loss Amount"].std() / quarterly_data["Net Loss Amount"].mean()

# Hit Rate Example (for threshold of significant loss)
threshold = 100000  # Define a significant loss threshold
yearly_hits = (yearly_data["Net Loss Amount"] > threshold).sum()
quarterly_hits = (quarterly_data["Net Loss Amount"] > threshold).sum()

yearly_hit_rate = yearly_hits / len(yearly_data)
quarterly_hit_rate = quarterly_hits / len(quarterly_data)

# Print Results

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To compare quarterly and yearly calculations of net loss amounts for each business line and provide insights to your client, you can use the following approach:

1. Aggregate Data:
You will calculate the net loss amounts for each business line on both yearly and quarterly bases.

Steps:
For yearly data: Group by Business Line and Year, summing the net loss amounts.
For quarterly data: Group by Business Line, Year, and Quarter, summing the net loss amounts.
python
Copy code
# Aggregate data yearly
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
yearly_data = df.groupby(['Business Line', 'Year'])['Net Loss Amount'].sum().reset_index()

# Aggregate data quarterly
df['Quarter'] = df['Date'].dt.quarter
quarterly_data = df.groupby(['Business Line', 'Year', 'Quarter'])['Net Loss Amount'].sum().reset_index()
2. Comparison Metrics:
To evaluate which granularity (yearly or quarterly) provides more insights, use the following metrics:

a. Variance/Standard Deviation:
Purpose: Shows the variability in net loss amounts. Higher variability in quarterly data might indicate seasonal patterns or fluctuations.

python
Copy code
# Variance for yearly data
yearly_variance = yearly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].var()

# Variance for quarterly data
quarterly_variance = quarterly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].var()
b. Trend Analysis:
Purpose: Identify patterns (e.g., is net loss increasing or decreasing over time?). Trends may be clearer on a yearly basis.

Use time series decomposition to identify the trend component for yearly and quarterly data.

python
Copy code
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Decomposition example for yearly data
business_line_data = yearly_data[yearly_data['Business Line'] == 'Retail']  # Example for one business line
decomposed = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(business_line_data['Net Loss Amount'], model='additive', period=1)
decomposed.plot()
c. Correlation Analysis:
Purpose: Compare quarterly and yearly data correlations across business lines.

For example, if quarterly data shows weak correlations between quarters, it might highlight seasonality.

python
Copy code
yearly_correlation = yearly_data.pivot(index='Year', columns='Business Line', values='Net Loss Amount').corr()
quarterly_correlation = quarterly_data.pivot(index=['Year', 'Quarter'], columns='Business Line', values='Net Loss Amount').corr()
d. Frequency of Outliers:
Purpose: Check for outliers (e.g., unusually high or low losses). Quarterly data might reveal spikes that yearly data smooths over.

python
Copy code
# Identify outliers using IQR for quarterly data
q1 = quarterly_data['Net Loss Amount'].quantile(0.25)
q3 = quarterly_data['Net Loss Amount'].quantile(0.75)
iqr = q3 - q1

outliers_quarterly = quarterly_data[
    (quarterly_data['Net Loss Amount'] < (q1 - 1.5 * iqr)) |
    (quarterly_data['Net Loss Amount'] > (q3 + 1.5 * iqr))
]

# Repeat for yearly data
e. Coefficient of Variation (CV):
Purpose: Evaluate the relative variability (variance/mean). A higher CV indicates more fluctuation in the data, which may suggest that quarterly data captures more insights.

python
Copy code
cv_yearly = yearly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].std() / yearly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].mean()
cv_quarterly = quarterly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].std() / quarterly_data.groupby('Business Line')['Net Loss Amount'].mean()
3. Visualization:
Visualize the comparisons to present to your client.

a. Variability Comparison:
Plot the variance or CV for both yearly and quarterly data for each business line.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Variance bar plot
plt.bar(yearly_variance.index, yearly_variance.values, label='Yearly Variance', alpha=0.7)
plt.bar(quarterly_variance.index, quarterly_variance.values, label='Quarterly Variance', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Variance Comparison: Yearly vs Quarterly')
plt.xlabel('Business Line')
plt.ylabel('Variance')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
b. Trends:
Use line plots to show trends in net loss amounts over time (yearly vs quarterly).

python
Copy code
# Example: Line plot for a single business line
plt.plot(yearly_data['Year'], yearly_data['Net Loss Amount'], label='Yearly', marker='o')
plt.plot(
    quarterly_data.groupby(['Year', 'Quarter'])['Net Loss Amount'].sum().index,
    quarterly_data.groupby(['Year', 'Quarter'])['Net Loss Amount'].sum().values,
    label='Quarterly',
    marker='o'
)
plt.title('Trend Comparison: Yearly vs Quarterly')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Net Loss Amount')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
4. Recommendations:
Quarterly Analysis:
Better for identifying seasonal trends and outliers.
Useful if losses vary significantly throughout the year (e.g., due to specific events or quarters).
Yearly Analysis:
Better for long-term trend detection and overall patterns.
Helps summarize data and reduces noise from short-term fluctuations.
5. Conclusion to the Client:
Present both metrics and visualizations to show the value of both granularities.
Recommend quarterly analysis for identifying patterns and anomalies within the year.
Use yearly analysis for high-level summaries and long-term planning.
By combining both views, you provide a comprehensive understanding of net loss behavior.

To address your client's request for more insights into quarterly vs yearly net loss for each business line, you can create an explorable comparison using specific metrics, visualizations, and statistical measures that highlight key patterns and explain the differences effectively.

1. Metrics for Comparison
Here are some metrics and techniques to provide clarity:

a. Moving Averages (MA):
Purpose: Smooth fluctuations and highlight trends in net loss over time.
How to use: Calculate MA for both quarterly and yearly net loss data.
Quarterly: Use a 3-period moving average (previous and next quarter included).
Yearly: Use a 2-period moving average (compare consecutive years).
b. Growth Rate (% Change):
Purpose: Show the rate of change in net loss over quarters or years.
How to use: Use percentage change for both yearly and quarterly data.
c. Seasonal Patterns (Quarterly Focus):
Purpose: Highlight seasonal effects that may only be visible on a quarterly basis.
How to use: Compare losses in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 across multiple years for each business line.
d. Variability (Standard Deviation or Coefficient of Variation):
Purpose: Assess which granularity (quarterly or yearly) shows more variability, indicating higher volatility or seasonal patterns.
e. Rolling Trendline (Explainability):
Purpose: Detect and visualize momentum in net loss trends using rolling averages for both quarterly and yearly data.
2. Graphs for Comparison
Here are some graphical techniques you can use to visually compare quarterly and yearly trends:

a. Overlay Line Graphs:
Purpose: Compare trends side by side.
How to implement:
Plot yearly and quarterly data on the same graph with distinct colors or markers.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example for one business line (e.g., "Retail")
business_line = "Retail"

# Filter yearly and quarterly data for the business line
yearly_data_bl = yearly_data[yearly_data['Business Line'] == business_line]
quarterly_data_bl = quarterly_data[quarterly_data['Business Line'] == business_line]

# Plot yearly data

It is also asking like increase the frequency by 10% and get lost also by 10% and then do the simulation for 90% 95% with Monte Carlo approach
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To address your client's request for increasing frequency and loss values by 10%, followed by Monte Carlo simulations for 90% and 95% confidence intervals, follow these steps:

1. Steps to Modify Data
a. Increase Frequency by 10%
Approach: Multiply the number of events (frequency) for each quarter/year by 1.1.
b. Increase Net Loss by 10%
Approach: Multiply the net loss values for each event by 1.1.
c. Prepare Adjusted Data for Simulation
Combine the adjusted frequency and net loss values to create a dataset ready for Monte Carlo simulations.
2. Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation estimates the potential range of outcomes by:

Sampling: Simulate data based on the adjusted frequency and loss.
Modeling Distribution: Fit a lognormal or other heavy-tailed distribution to the adjusted data.
Generating Scenarios: Run simulations to calculate total losses for 90% and 95% confidence intervals.
3. Implementation
Step 1: Adjust Frequency and Loss Values
python
Copy code
# Increase frequency and net loss by 10%
adjusted_data = original_data.copy()
adjusted_data['Frequency'] *= 1.1  # Increase frequency by 10%
adjusted_data['Net Loss Amount'] *= 1.1  # Increase net loss by 10%
Step 2: Fit a Distribution
Choose a lognormal or another heavy-tailed distribution, often used in operational loss modeling.

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import lognorm

# Fit lognormal distribution to Net Loss Amount
shape, loc, scale = lognorm.fit(adjusted_data['Net Loss Amount'])

# Generate simulated losses using the fitted distribution
simulated_losses = lognorm.rvs(shape, loc=loc, scale=scale, size=100000)
Step 3: Calculate Total Losses for Each Simulation
Aggregate simulated losses for each year or quarter and calculate confidence intervals.

python
Copy code
# Monte Carlo simulation for total losses
n_simulations = 100000
total_losses = []

for _ in range(n_simulations):
    sampled_losses = np.random.choice(simulated_losses, size=int(adjusted_data['Frequency'].sum()))
    total_losses.append(sampled_losses.sum())

# Calculate 90% and 95% confidence intervals
confidence_90 = np.percentile(total_losses, 90)
confidence_95 = np.percentile(total_losses, 95)

print(f"90% Confidence Interval Total Loss: {confidence_90}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval Total Loss: {confidence_95}")
4. Visualization
a. Histogram of Simulated Losses
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(total_losses, bins=50, color='skyblue', alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(confidence_90, color='orange', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2, label="90% CI")
plt.axvline(confidence_95, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2, label="95% CI")
plt.title("Monte Carlo Simulated Total Losses")
plt.xlabel("Total Loss")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
b. Comparison of Adjusted vs Original Losses
Plot the original and adjusted losses side by side for transparency.

python
Copy code
plt.boxplot(
    [original_data['Net Loss Amount'], adjusted_data['Net Loss Amount']],
    labels=['Original Loss', 'Adjusted Loss (+10%)']
)
plt.title("Original vs Adjusted Net Loss Amounts")
plt.ylabel("Net Loss Amount")
plt.show()
5. Explanation to Client
Objective: Demonstrate the impact of a 10% increase in frequency and net loss on total losses.
Insights from Simulation:
90% CI: Provide an estimate where 90% of the simulated total losses fall below a certain threshold.
95% CI: Provide an estimate where 95% of the simulated total losses fall below a certain threshold.
The increased frequency and loss amplify the total loss exposure, highlighting risks.
Visualization: Show simulations as histograms, confidence intervals as vertical lines, and comparisons between original and adjusted losses.
6. Deliverable Summary
Data Adjustments: Explain the 10% increase in frequency and net loss.
Simulation Results: Share the total loss estimates for 90% and 95% confidence intervals.
Visuals: Provide histograms, box plots, and comparison graphs.
Recommendations: Suggest whether quarterly or yearly granularity provides better insights based on variability and patterns in the simulation.

Increase the event count by 10% for each business line and net loss for each business line by 10% code for that
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s Python code to increase the event count and net loss for each business line by 10%:

Code Implementation
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = {
    "Business Line": ["Retail", "Corporate Banking", "Investment Banking", "Insurance"],
    "Event Count": [100, 200, 150, 250],
    "Net Loss Amount": [500000, 1200000, 800000, 1000000]
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Increase Event Count and Net Loss Amount by 10%
df["Adjusted Event Count"] = df["Event Count"] * 1.1  # Increase by 10%
df["Adjusted Net Loss Amount"] = df["Net Loss Amount"] * 1.1  # Increase by 10%

# Convert to integers for event counts (optional)
df["Adjusted Event Count"] = df["Adjusted Event Count"].round(0).astype(int)

# Display the updated DataFrame
print(df)
Explanation
Columns Adjusted:

Event Count is increased by multiplying by 1.1.
Net Loss Amount is similarly increased by multiplying by 1.1.
Rounding:

Event counts are rounded to the nearest integer for practical reporting.
Result:

The new columns (Adjusted Event Count and Adjusted Net Loss Amount) reflect the updated values after a 10% increase.
Output
If the original data looks like this:

Business Line	Event Count	Net Loss Amount
Retail	100	500,000
Corporate Banking	200	1,200,000
Investment Banking	150	800,000
Insurance	250	1,000,000
The output will be:

Business Line	Event Count	Net Loss Amount	Adjusted Event Count	Adjusted Net Loss Amount
Retail	100	500,000	110	550,000
Corporate Banking	200	1,200,000	220	1,320,000
Investment Banking	150	800,000	165	880,000
Insurance	250	1,000,000	275	1,100,000

In this code I need year on x axis it should come like a year not like 2021.5,202.5 I don't want and also fix limit in both y axis
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure that the year appears as discrete values (i.e., 2021, 2022, etc.) on the x-axis and that both y-axes have fixed limits, you can make the following adjustments:

Set the X-axis to be categorical (so the years are treated as discrete points, not as continuous values).
Set fixed limits on both y-axes to ensure they have a proper range.
Here’s the updated code:

Updated Code:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the simulation results are stored in `simulation_results_df`

# Filter out data for plotting
plot_data = simulation_results_df.groupby('Year').agg(
    {'Actual Total Net Loss': 'sum', 'VaR Net Loss (99.9%)': 'mean'}).reset_index()

# Create figure and axis
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot Total Net Loss (primary y-axis)
ax1.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'], color='b', marker='o', label='Total Net Loss')
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Total Net Loss', color='b')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')

# Set the limit for the primary y-axis (Total Net Loss)
ax1.set_ylim([0, plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'].max() * 1.2])  # Add a margin of 20%

# Create a second y-axis for VaR Net Loss
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'], color='r', marker='s', label='VaR Net Loss (99.9%)')
ax2.set_ylabel('VaR Net Loss (99.9%)', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')

# Set the limit for the secondary y-axis (VaR Net Loss)
ax2.set_ylim([0, plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'].max() * 1.2])  # Add a margin of 20%

# Set the x-axis to be discrete (years as categories)
ax1.set_xticks(plot_data['Year'])  # Use years as discrete ticks
ax1.set_xticklabels(plot_data['Year'].astype(str))  # Ensure the years are shown as strings

# Add title and legend
plt.title('Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) per Year')
fig.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Key Updates:
X-Axis as Discrete Years:

ax1.set_xticks(plot_data['Year']): This makes sure the x-axis ticks correspond to each unique year.
ax1.set_xticklabels(plot_data['Year'].astype(str)): This ensures that the years are displayed as discrete values (e.g., 2021, 2022, etc.).
Fixed Y-Axis Limits:

ax1.set_ylim([0, plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'].max() * 1.2]): Sets the primary y-axis (Total Net Loss) with a 20% margin above the maximum value.
ax2.set_ylim([0, plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'].max() * 1.2]): Sets the secondary y-axis (VaR Net Loss) with a 20% margin above the maximum value.
Expected Outcome:
The x-axis will display discrete year labels (e.g., 2021, 2022, etc.), not floating-point values like 2021.5.
Both the Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss values will have fixed y-axis limits, making it easier to compare the two values across years.
Let me know if you need further tweaks!






You said:
Inam getting x axis .5 interwell yaer I  need only year like 2021,2022,2023
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure the x-axis shows only the year values (e.g., 2021, 2022, 2023) without any fractional intervals (like 2021.5), you need to make sure that matplotlib treats the years as categorical data, not continuous numeric data. You can achieve this by explicitly setting the x-axis to use integer year values.

Here’s the updated solution:

Solution to Ensure Discrete Year Values:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the simulation results are stored in `simulation_results_df`

# Filter out data for plotting
plot_data = simulation_results_df.groupby('Year').agg(
    {'Actual Total Net Loss': 'sum', 'VaR Net Loss (99.9%)': 'mean'}).reset_index()

# Create figure and axis
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot Total Net Loss (primary y-axis)
ax1.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'], color='b', marker='o', label='Total Net Loss')
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Total Net Loss', color='b')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')

# Set the limit for the primary y-axis (Total Net Loss)
ax1.set_ylim([0, plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'].max() * 1.2])  # Add a margin of 20%

# Create a second y-axis for VaR Net Loss
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'], color='r', marker='s', label='VaR Net Loss (99.9%)')
ax2.set_ylabel('VaR Net Loss (99.9%)', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')

# Set the limit for the secondary y-axis (VaR Net Loss)
ax2.set_ylim([0, plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'].max() * 1.2])  # Add a margin of 20%

# Set the x-axis to display years as discrete integer values
ax1.set_xticks(plot_data['Year'])  # Use years as discrete ticks
ax1.set_xticklabels(plot_data['Year'].astype(str), rotation=0)  # Ensure years are displayed as strings

# Add title and legend
plt.title('Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) per Year')
fig.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Key Updates:
Fixing X-Axis to Discrete Years:
ax1.set_xticks(plot_data['Year']): This ensures that the x-axis uses the exact years in the dataset as discrete ticks (2021, 2022, etc.).
ax1.set_xticklabels(plot_data['Year'].astype(str), rotation=0): This makes sure that the year labels appear as strings (i.e., '2021', '2022') without fractional values or decimals. The rotation=0 keeps the labels horizontal.
Expected Outcome:
The x-axis will only display the years (2021, 2022, 2023, etc.), with no fractional values like 2021.5, 2022.5.
The plot will have a discrete x-axis with each year corresponding to a point on the graph, making the data easier to interpret.

I need grapgh on x axis years and yaxs1 total net loss and y axis2 var net loss with proper legend and label value
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To generate a graph with Years on the X-axis, Total Net Loss on the primary Y-axis, and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) on the secondary Y-axis, we can use matplotlib with a twin axis. Here's how you can do it:

Code to Plot the Graph:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the simulation results are stored in `simulation_results_df`

# Filter out data for plotting
plot_data = simulation_results_df.groupby('Year').agg(
    {'Actual Total Net Loss': 'sum', 'VaR Net Loss (99.9%)': 'mean'}).reset_index()

# Create figure and axis
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot Total Net Loss (primary y-axis)
ax1.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'], color='b', marker='o', label='Total Net Loss')
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Total Net Loss', color='b')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')

# Create a second y-axis for VaR Net Loss
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'], color='r', marker='s', label='VaR Net Loss (99.9%)')
ax2.set_ylabel('VaR Net Loss (99.9%)', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')

# Add title and legend
plt.title('Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) per Year')
fig.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Explanation of the Plot:
X-Axis: Represents the Year.
Primary Y-Axis (ax1): Represents the Total Net Loss for each year.
Blue line: Total net loss (summed over each year).
Secondary Y-Axis (ax2): Represents the VaR Net Loss (99.9%) for each year.
Red line: VaR value for the year (calculated based on Monte Carlo simulation for actual data).
Legend: Proper legends are placed to distinguish between the total net loss and VaR net loss lines.
Labels: Both axes are labeled with appropriate names, and the tick colors are customized to match the corresponding data series.
Expected Output:
A graph with two lines: one for total net loss and another for VaR net loss, each plotted against the years.
Both axes will have appropriate labels and colors for easy distinction between the two data series.
This should generate a graph that helps in visually comparing Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss over the years.

You said:
Can I show total net loss value at risk net loss and the event count also on the graph
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can show the Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss (99.9%), and Event Count on the graph by using annotations. This will allow you to display the exact values for each point on the graph, making it more informative.

Here’s how you can add the actual values to the graph:

Code to Plot the Graph with Annotations for Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss, and Event Count:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the simulation results are stored in `simulation_results_df`

# Filter out data for plotting
plot_data = simulation_results_df.groupby('Year').agg(
    {'Actual Total Net Loss': 'sum', 'VaR Net Loss (99.9%)': 'mean', 'Actual Total Event Count': 'sum'}).reset_index()

# Create figure and axis
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot Total Net Loss (primary y-axis)
ax1.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'], color='b', marker='o', label='Total Net Loss')
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Total Net Loss', color='b')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')

# Annotate Total Net Loss values
for i, txt in enumerate(plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss']):
    ax1.annotate(f'{txt:.2f}', (plot_data['Year'][i], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'][i]),
                 textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0, 10), ha='center', fontsize=9, color='b')

# Create a second y-axis for VaR Net Loss
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'], color='r', marker='s', label='VaR Net Loss (99.9%)')
ax2.set_ylabel('VaR Net Loss (99.9%)', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')

# Annotate VaR Net Loss values
for i, txt in enumerate(plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)']):
    ax2.annotate(f'{txt:.2f}', (plot_data['Year'][i], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'][i]),
                 textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0, 10), ha='center', fontsize=9, color='r')

# Plot Event Count on a third axis
ax3 = ax1.twinx()
ax3.spines['right'].set_position(('outward', 60))  # Move the third axis to the right
ax3.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Event Count'], color='g', marker='^', label='Event Count')
ax3.set_ylabel('Event Count', color='g')
ax3.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='g')

# Annotate Event Count values
for i, txt in enumerate(plot_data['Actual Total Event Count']):
    ax3.annotate(f'{txt}', (plot_data['Year'][i], plot_data['Actual Total Event Count'][i]),
                 textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0, 10), ha='center', fontsize=9, color='g')

# Add title and legend
plt.title('Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss (99.9%) and Event Count per Year')
fig.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Explanation of the Modifications:
Event Count on a Third Y-Axis:

We added a third y-axis (ax3) to plot Event Count.
The third axis is moved slightly outward using ax3.spines['right'].set_position(('outward', 60)) to avoid overlapping with the second y-axis.
Annotations:

For each line (Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss, and Event Count), we added annotations using the ax1.annotate() function for Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss, and ax3.annotate() for Event Count.
These annotations display the actual values at each point on the graph.
Text is positioned slightly above each point (xytext=(0, 10)), and the text color matches the line color (blue, red, or green).
Legend and Labels:

Legends are automatically handled by label parameters in the plot() function.
The axis labels reflect the specific metric: Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss, and Event Count.
Expected Output:
X-Axis: Represents the Year.
Primary Y-Axis (Blue Line): Total Net Loss per year, with values annotated above each data point.
Secondary Y-Axis (Red Line): VaR Net Loss (99.9%) per year, with values annotated above each data point.
Third Y-Axis (Green Line): Event Count per year, with values annotated above each data point.
Legends and Labels: Clear legends and axis labels to distinguish between Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss, and Event Count.
This will result in a highly informative plot where you can easily compare Total Net Loss, VaR Net Loss, and Event Count over the years, along with their corresponding values.

To create a comparison graph between Value at Risk (VaR) Net Loss and Actual Net Loss over the years, we can plot both values on the same graph with the Year on the X-axis. This graph will allow you to compare how the actual net losses align with the VaR estimates over time.

Code for Comparison Graph:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the simulation results are stored in `simulation_results_df`

# Filter out data for plotting
plot_data = simulation_results_df.groupby('Year').agg(
    {'Actual Total Net Loss': 'sum', 'VaR Net Loss (99.9%)': 'mean'}).reset_index()

# Create figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot Actual Total Net Loss (primary y-axis)
ax.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'], color='b', marker='o', label='Actual Total Net Loss', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)

# Plot VaR Net Loss (99.9%) on the same axis
ax.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'], color='r', marker='s', label='VaR Net Loss (99.9%)', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('Year')
ax.set_ylabel('Amount in $')
ax.set_title('Comparison of Actual Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) per Year')

# Show legend
ax.legend()

# Add annotations for each year (optional)
for i in range(len(plot_data)):
    ax.annotate(f'{plot_data["Actual Total Net Loss"][i]:,.2f}', 
                (plot_data['Year'][i], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'][i]),
                textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0, 10), ha='center', fontsize=9, color='b')

    ax.annotate(f'{plot_data["VaR Net Loss (99.9%)"][i]:,.2f}', 
                (plot_data['Year'][i], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'][i]),
                textcoords="offset points", xytext=(0, -15), ha='center', fontsize=9, color='r')

# Show the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Explanation of the Graph:
X-Axis: Represents the Year.
Y-Axis: Represents the Amount in $ (for both Actual Net Loss and VaR Net Loss).
Actual Total Net Loss (Blue Line): Plotted as a solid blue line with circles ('o') at each data point.
VaR Net Loss (99.9%) (Red Dashed Line): Plotted as a dashed red line with squares ('s') at each data point.
Annotations: Optional annotations are added above each data point to display the exact values for both Actual Net Loss and VaR Net Loss, which can make the graph more informative.
Legend: The legend distinguishes between Actual Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%).
Title and Labels: The title and axis labels are provided for clarity.
Expected Output:
A graph with two lines:
The solid blue line represents the Actual Total Net Loss over the years.
The dashed red line represents the VaR Net Loss (99.9%) over the same period.
The annotations show the actual values for both Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss at each year.
The legend allows you to distinguish between the two lines.
This comparison graph will allow you to visually assess how Actual Total Net Loss compares with the VaR Net Loss (99.9%) across the years.

To fix the limits of both the primary and secondary y-axes in your graph, you can set the ylim property for each axis. This ensures that both axes have a predefined range, making it easier to compare the two sets of values.

Here’s how you can set fixed limits for both the y-axes:

Updated Code with Fixed Y-Axis Limits:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the simulation results are stored in `simulation_results_df`

# Filter out data for plotting
plot_data = simulation_results_df.groupby('Year').agg(
    {'Actual Total Net Loss': 'sum', 'VaR Net Loss (99.9%)': 'mean'}).reset_index()

# Create figure and axis
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot Total Net Loss (primary y-axis)
ax1.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'], color='b', marker='o', label='Total Net Loss')
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Total Net Loss', color='b')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')

# Set the limit for the primary y-axis (Total Net Loss)
ax1.set_ylim([0, plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'].max() * 1.1])  # Add a margin of 10%

# Create a second y-axis for VaR Net Loss
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(plot_data['Year'], plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'], color='r', marker='s', label='VaR Net Loss (99.9%)')
ax2.set_ylabel('VaR Net Loss (99.9%)', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')

# Set the limit for the secondary y-axis (VaR Net Loss)
ax2.set_ylim([0, plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'].max() * 1.1])  # Add a margin of 10%

# Add title and legend
plt.title('Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) per Year')
fig.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Explanation of Changes:
Setting Limits for Primary Y-Axis (Total Net Loss):

ax1.set_ylim([0, plot_data['Actual Total Net Loss'].max() * 1.1]): This sets the y-axis limits for the primary axis (Total Net Loss). We use the maximum value of the Actual Total Net Loss and add a 10% margin to ensure the graph isn't cramped.
Setting Limits for Secondary Y-Axis (VaR Net Loss):

ax2.set_ylim([0, plot_data['VaR Net Loss (99.9%)'].max() * 1.1]): This sets the y-axis limits for the secondary axis (VaR Net Loss). We use the maximum value of the VaR Net Loss (99.9%) and add a 10% margin.
Expected Outcome:
The Total Net Loss and VaR Net Loss (99.9%) lines will be plotted with fixed y-axis limits.
Both axes will have consistent scaling and margins for easier comparison.
You can adjust the multiplier (* 1.1) to change the margin if needed.

This code calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) for both net losses and event counts for each business line across different years, leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique with the Poisson and Log-Normal distributions. Here's a breakdown of the code and its components:

Key Components
Distributions:

Poisson Distribution models the frequency of events (event counts).
Log-Normal Distribution models the severity of losses (positive net losses).
Monte Carlo Simulation:

Used to simulate a large number of possible scenarios for event counts and loss amounts.
Aggregates simulated results to determine the 99.9% VaR (extreme loss thresholds).
Parameters:

frequency_lambda: Average number of events per year (calculated from historical data).
severity_shape, severity_loc, severity_scale: Parameters fitted to positive net losses.
Results Summary:

Total Net Loss: Sum of net losses for each year and business line.
Total Event Count: Total number of events in the dataset for the specified criteria.
VaR Net Loss (99.9%): 99.9% quantile of simulated total losses.
VaR Event Count (99.9%): 99.9% quantile of simulated event counts.
Steps Performed:
Filter Data:

Loop over each year and business line to process data specific to that combination.
Frequency and Severity Calculation:

Compute frequency_lambda from historical event counts.
Fit a Log-Normal distribution to the positive net losses to estimate severity parameters.
VaR Computation:

Use custom functions calculate_net_loss_var and calculate_event_count_var to compute VaR values.
Result Compilation:

Append the computed metrics into a results list, converted into a DataFrame for analysis.
Output Example
The resulting DataFrame (results_df) will look like:

Year	Business Line	Total Net Loss	Total Event Count	VaR Net Loss (99.9%)	VaR Event Count (99.9%)
2021	Retail	-123456.78	250	34567.89	300
2021	Corporate Banking	-87654.32	150	56789.12	200
...	...	...	...	...	...
Next Steps
Visualize Results:

Create bar charts or heatmaps to show VaR trends across years and business lines.
Compare total net losses with computed VaR values.
Error Handling:

Handle cases with insufficient positive net losses for specific business lines or years.
Validation:

Cross-check simulated results with historical data for reliability.

Explanation
Historical Data Preparation:

Aggregate the data by Quarter and Business Line.
Summarize metrics like Total Net Loss and Total Event Count.
Time Series Model:

Use Exponential Smoothing to predict values for Total Net Loss and Total Event Count.
Forecast for VaR Metrics:

Use the latest historical distribution parameters (severity_shape, severity_loc, severity_scale) for Net Loss.
Estimate VaR for 2025 Q1 using simulated data based on predicted values.
Output Sample
The resulting DataFrame (results_df) will include rows for 2025Q1:

Year	Quarter	Business Line	Total Net Loss	Total Event Count	VaR Net Loss (99.9%)	VaR Event Count (99.9%)
2025	2025Q1	Retail	-145000.34	175	37000.45	220
