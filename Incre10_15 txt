Explanation
Scaling Frequency and Net Loss:

Frequency (λ) is scaled by multiplying it by 1.10 (10%) and 1.15 (15%) for increased event counts.
Net Loss Amount (scale) is similarly scaled for severity.
Additional Columns:

VaR for Net Loss and Event Counts after a 10% and 15% increase is calculated and added to the results.
Error Handling:

Skips business lines with no positive net losses to ensure robust modeling.
Output:

The DataFrame (results_df) includes:
Original VaR values.
VaR values after increasing frequency and severity by 10% and 15%.

That year follow that we have used in for loop year 2021-25 is it required

The inclusion of the year loop (2021–2025) depends on the requirements of your analysis. Here's a breakdown to help you decide:

When to Include the Year Loop
Yearly Trends or Comparisons:

If your analysis requires understanding how net loss and event counts vary year-over-year, then the loop is essential.
It helps capture trends specific to individual years, allowing clients to see temporal changes.
Granular Insights:

For clients interested in both yearly and quarterly insights, the year loop ensures that data is segregated properly.
Temporal Forecasting:

If Monte Carlo simulations or VaR calculations are to be compared across years, you must retain the loop to process data year by year.
When the Year Loop Can Be Skipped
Aggregate Analysis:

If the goal is to analyze all data as a whole (irrespective of years), you can omit the year loop.
In this case, process data directly for all available records, grouped only by business line or other relevant features.
Single-Timeframe Insights:

If the client focuses on one specific time frame (e.g., quarterly), the year loop may not be needed.
How to Modify for Aggregate Analysis
Here’s how you can modify the code to skip the year loop:

python
Copy code
# Loop through each business line only (no year loop)
for business_line in df['Business Line'].unique():
    # Filter data for the specific business line
    bl_data = df[df['Business Line'] == business_line]
    
    # Total event counts and net loss
    total_event_count = bl_data.shape[0]
    total_net_loss = bl_data['Net Loss Amount'].sum()
    
    # Frequency parameter (Poisson λ)
    frequency_lambda = total_event_count / len(df['Year'].unique())  # Average events per year
    
    # Severity parameters (Log-Normal distribution)
    positive_losses = bl_data[bl_data['Net Loss Amount'] > 0]['Net Loss Amount']
    if positive_losses.empty:
        print(f"No positive losses for {business_line}. Skipping.")
        continue
    severity_shape, severity_loc, severity_scale = lognorm.fit(positive_losses)
    
    # Calculate original and scaled VaR values (similar to previous logic)
    # ...
Final Recommendation
If the client explicitly requests yearly insights or year-specific comparisons (e.g., quarter vs. year), retain the year loop.
If the client wants overall insights for all available data, skip the year loop and proceed with a higher-level analysis.
Let me know your client's preference, and I can adjust the implementation accordingly!

I need that 10% in 15% analysis for quarter wise also so I had quarter also in the output
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To incorporate 10% and 15% increase analysis for quarter-wise data as well, you need to include both year and quarter in the loop. This way, we can analyze the data for each quarter of each year and apply the percentage increase to both frequency (event counts) and severity (net loss).

    simulated_loss_amounts = lognorm.rvs(s=severity_shape, loc=severity_loc, scale=severity_scale, size=n_simulations)
    total_losses = simulated_event_counts * simulated_loss_amounts

Explanation of Additions
Quarter-wise Breakdown:

Added a loop for quarters to analyze quarterly data for each business line within each year.
10% and 15% Increase:

Adjusted frequency (frequency_lambda) and severity (severity_scale) by multiplying them by 1.1 (10%) and 1.15 (15%), respectively.
Separate Columns:

The output includes separate columns for VaR calculations after applying 10% and 15% increases.
Output Structure
The results_df will include the following columns:

Year: Year of the data.
Quarter: Quarter of the year (e.g., Q1, Q2, etc.).
Business Line: Business line name.
Total Net Loss: Total net loss in the quarter.
Total Event Count: Total events in the quarter.
VaR Net Loss (99.9%): VaR for Net Loss at 99.9% confidence level.
VaR Event Count (99.9%): VaR for Event Count at 99.9% confidence level.
